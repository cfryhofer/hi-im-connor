Thank you for looking at this! Please make or use a folder named "output_files" within the folder containing the "FinalProjectPart1.py" file.
The CSV files that are created by the code will be placed in the "output_files" folder.
Make sure to have the csv files "ManufacturerList.csv", "PriceList.csv", and "ServiceDatesList.csv" in the folder with "FinalProjectPart1.py" file for the file to have data to work with.
