Thank you for looking at this! Please make or use a folder named "output_files" within the folder containing the FinalProjectPart1.py file.
The CSV files that are created by the code will be placed in the "output_files" folder.
Also, when you run the code it will ask you for the item manufacturer and item type. Make sure to use a capital letter for the manufacturer, for example, with "Apple laptop".
