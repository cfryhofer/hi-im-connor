Thank you for looking at this! Please make or use a folder named "output_files" within the folder containing the "FinalProjectPart1.py" file.
The CSV files that are created by the code will be placed in the "output_files" folder.
Also, when you run the code it will ask you for the item manufacturer and item type. Make sure to use a capital letter for the manufacturer, for example, with "Apple laptop".
Make sure to have the csv files "ManufacturerList.csv", "PriceList.csv", and "ServiceDatesList.csv" in the folder with "FinalProjectPart1.py" file for the file to have data to work with.
